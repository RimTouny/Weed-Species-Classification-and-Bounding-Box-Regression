# **Weed Species Classification and Bounding Box Regression**
Leveraging advanced image processing and deep learning, this project focuses on CNNs and the Keras API for image processing and regression tasks related to plant images, particularly weed species from [Plant Seedlings dataset](https://vision.eng.au.dk/plant-seedlings-dataset/)"I worked on a subset". The project involves data preparation, basic transfer learning using the VGG-16 model, classification, and regression networks. Regularization methods are applied to improve the model, and discussions on overfitting and the impact of regularization are included. The submission requires a Jupyter file containing the solution, and late submissions are not allowed. It's contributes to understanding CNNs, transfer learning, and handling small training data. This project holds significance within my Master's in Computer Vision at uOttawa (2023).

## Image classification and bounding box regression using transfer learning with a VGG-16 model.
The dataset comprises 4 classes with 250 images each, divided into training,and testing sets, images size are differnet: Cleavers, Common Chickweed, Maize, Shepherdâ€™s Purse,

## **Key Tasks Undertaken**    
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Uploaded a subset of the dataset  from Google Drive.
   - Extracted the dataset and organized it into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing sets.

2. **Classification Network (Transfer Learning):**
   - Used the VGG-16 model for transfer learning.
   - Modified the model by adding custom layers for classification.
   ```python
      # Add custom layers
      x = Conv2D(256, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
      x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
      x = Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')(x)
      x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(x)
      x = Flatten()(x)
      outputs = Dense(4, activation='softmax')(x)  # Output layer for 4 classes
      ```
   - One-hot encoded the labels.
   - Trained the classification model, monitored convergence, and visualized learning curves.
