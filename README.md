# Weed-Species-Classification-and-Bounding-Box-Regression
Leveraging advanced image processing and deep learning, this project classifies plant images using a subset of the Plant Seedlings dataset. The dataset includes diverse plant species captured under varying conditions. This project holds significance within my Master's in Computer Vision at uOttawa (2023).
